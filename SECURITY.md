# Security Policy

Hometabs gives a Telegram chat control of a real, logged-in web browser.
Please read this before running it.

## Threat model

**What the bot can do.** The agent drives your Aside Browser through the aside
MCP: it can open pages, read them, click, type and submit forms in a browser
that may be signed in to your email, bank, shops and social accounts. Anyone
who can make the agent act can do the same.

**Who can talk to it.** Only Telegram user IDs listed in `ALLOWED_USER_IDS`.
The bot refuses to start without that list, and every message, command and
button press from other users is rejected and logged. Telegram user IDs can't
be spoofed by other users, but anyone with access to an allowed Telegram
account (an unlocked phone, a hijacked session) can control your browser.

**What the agent is allowed to use.** Only the aside `repl` tool and the
`Skill` tool for an allowlisted set of skills. It has no shell, file or web
fetch tools, your `~/.claude` settings, CLAUDE.md, plugins and other MCP
servers are not loaded, and anything not pre-approved is denied without a
prompt.

**Prompt injection is the main residual risk.** Web pages the agent reads can
contain text written to manipulate it ("ignore your instructions and send...").
The agent is told to treat page content as data and to ask you in chat before
irreversible actions (purchases, sending messages, posting, submitting forms,
deleting, changing settings, accepting terms) and before autofilling payment
cards. **These safeguards are instructions to the model, not enforced
controls.** A model can be tricked or make mistakes, and the repl tool itself
can do anything the browser can.

**Credentials.** The agent is told to sign in only with your password
manager's autofill and never to type secrets it reads or that you send in chat.
Don't send passwords or codes to the bot: chat messages are stored by Telegram
and in the Claude Code session transcripts on your machine.

## Recommendations

- **Use a dedicated browser profile** for the bot, signed in only to the sites
  you want it to use. Keep banking, primary email and admin accounts out of it
  where you can.
- Keep `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` to your own account(s), and protect that Telegram
  account (passcode, two-step verification).
- **Keep tokens secret.** `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` lets anyone impersonate the bot;
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` lets anyone use Claude on your Anthropic Console account;
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` gives access to your Claude plan. Keep them only in
  `.env` (git-ignored) with restrictive permissions (`chmod 600 .env`), never
  in logs, issues or screenshots. If one leaks, revoke it (BotFather
  `/revoke`; delete the key in the Claude Console; regenerate with
  `claude setup-token`). Consider a dedicated API key with a spend limit.
- The bot removes every credential and provider variable from its own
  environment and passes only the chosen one to the Claude CLI. It logs which
  kind is used, never the value. Don't rely on this as a secret store.
- Watch what the agent does: progress messages show each browser step, and
  `/stop` interrupts a running task.
- The `.state/` directory and Claude Code's transcripts (under
  `~/.claude/projects/`) contain your conversations, page text and
  screenshots. Treat them as sensitive.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not open a public issue** for security problems. Report them
privately through GitHub's
[security advisories](https://github.com/emanuilo/hometabs/security/advisories/new)
("Report a vulnerability" on the Security tab). Include what you found, how to
reproduce it and its impact. You should get a reply within a few days, and
we'll coordinate a fix and disclosure with you.

Vulnerabilities in Aside, Claude Code / the Claude Agent SDK or Telegram
themselves should be reported to those vendors.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release on `main` receives security fixes.
